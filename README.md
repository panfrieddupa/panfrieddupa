Hello! I’m @panfrieddupa (or Bekah) <br>
I’m a polyglot developer currently finishing my last semester of an Information Technology diploma majoring in Software Development.
<br>
Currently I am working with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Angular.js, AJAX, axios, Rest API, Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, C and C#.
<br>
My favourite source code editor is Visual Studio Code, but I am proficient with Notepad++ and Sublime as well.
<br>
As for IDEs, I am well-versed with BlueJ, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, and Eclipse, though I am beginning to learn more about NetBeans.
